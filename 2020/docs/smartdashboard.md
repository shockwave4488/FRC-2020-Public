# SmartDashboard Know-How #
Smart dashboard is quite a piece of work... It has many caveats and tiny little
tid bits of intformation.

- Opening the Driverstation might start a second instance of the smart
  dashboard in the back ground. Please make sure to check for this as it might
  run an auto mode you did not intend to use. 
- When you start the smart dashboard while not tethered to a powered on robot,
  your autonomous radio buttons might decide to not show themselves. Anytime
  you restart the smartdashboard, please make sure you are powered on and
  tethered to the robot. If you do find yourself about to start a match with no
  radio buttons, simply close the dashboard and start it up again.
